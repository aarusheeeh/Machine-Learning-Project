# Predictive Modeling for Bike Sharing Demand

## Introduction
BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, seeks to accelerate its revenue post-Covid-19 lockdown by understanding the demand for shared bikes. To achieve this, they have collected a comprehensive dataset on daily bike demands across the American market. The objective is to build predictive models that can accurately forecast bike demand based on various factors, enabling BoomBikes to tailor their business strategy accordingly.

## Business Goal
The primary objective is to model the demand for shared bikes using available independent variables. By identifying significant predictors of bike demand and assessing their impact, BoomBikes aims to optimize their operations to meet customer expectations and maximize profits. Additionally, the model will provide insights into demand dynamics, facilitating strategic decision-making in new markets.

## Objectives
1. **Data Understanding and Cleanup**: Thoroughly analyze the dataset to identify any inconsistencies or missing values, and perform necessary data cleaning procedures to ensure the quality of input data for modeling.
2. **Build Regression Models**: Utilize regression techniques to develop predictive models for bike demand. Experiment with various algorithms and feature combinations to identify the most effective model.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of each regression model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as R-squared (R2), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), etc. Compare the performance of different models to determine the best-performing one.
4. **Documentation and Communication**: Document the entire modeling process, including data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation metrics. Communicate findings and recommendations effectively to the management team and stakeholders.

## Conclusion
Predictive modeling for bike sharing demand offers valuable insights into customer behavior and market dynamics, enabling BoomBikes to optimize their operations and capitalize on emerging opportunities. By leveraging data-driven approaches, BoomBikes can stay ahead of competitors and adapt to changing market conditions effectively.
